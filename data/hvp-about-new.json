  "description": "The NIH Human Virome Program (HVP) is a comprehensive research initiative aimed at characterizing the human viromeâ€”the collection of all viruses that inhabit the human body. The program seeks to understand how these viruses interact with human cells, the microbiome, and the immune system in both health and disease.",
