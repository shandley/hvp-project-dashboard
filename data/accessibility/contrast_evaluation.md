# Accessibility Contrast Evaluation

## Overview
This document evaluates the contrast ratios for the HVP Project Dashboard in both light and dark themes. WCAG 2.1 Level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18pt+) and UI components.

## Methodology
Evaluation of color pairs used in the dashboard based on the CSS variables in the theming system.

## Findings and Recommendations

### Issues Requiring Attention

1. **Light Theme Issues:**
   - Link text on main background: Contrast ratio of 3.7:1 fails for normal text
   - Status colors (success, error, info) on white: All below 4.5:1 ratio

2. **Dark Theme Issues:**

   - Link text on card backgrounds: 3.8:1 ratio fails for normal text

### Recommended Fixes

1. **Light Theme Improvements:**
   - Increase contrast of links on main background by darkening to #0056b3
   - Darken status colors for better contrast on white backgrounds:
     - Success: #1e8e3e (from #28a745)
     - Error: #c62828 (from #dc3545)
     - Info: #0277bd (from #17a2b8)

2. **Dark Theme Improvements:**

   - Brighten link color on card backgrounds to #5c8ee6 (from #4d7ed8)

## Summary

The majority of color combinations in both themes meet WCAG AA standards for contrast. The identified issues affect specific combinations that should be addressed to ensure full accessibility compliance. Most issues are with interactive elements and status indicators rather than primary content, but should still be addressed.
