# NIH Human Virome Program Dashboard - Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview

The NIH Human Virome Program (HVP) Dashboard will be a web-based visualization platform hosted on GitHub Pages to provide an interactive overview of the HVP's research projects, samples, and key metrics. The dashboard will serve as a central resource for program managers, researchers, and stakeholders to monitor project progress, explore data relationships, and identify trends across the program's diverse cohorts.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Platform Selection

- **GitHub Pages**: The dashboard will be hosted on GitHub Pages via the repository at https://github.com/shandley/hvp-project-dashboard
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js for component-based UI development
- **Visualization Libraries**:
  - D3.js for custom interactive visualizations
  - React-Vis or Chart.js for standard charts and graphs
  - Leaflet.js for geographic visualizations

### 2.2 Data Architecture

- **Data Storage**: Static JSON files generated from the CSV data sources
- **Data Processing**: Scripts to transform and aggregate the raw data into visualization-ready formats
- **Update Mechanism**: GitHub Actions workflow to automatically regenerate visualizations when data is updated

## 3. Data Sources and Processing

### 3.1 Primary Data Sources

- **HVP_master.csv**: Core dataset containing project details, cohort information, and sample metrics
- **additional-hvp-data.md**: Supplementary information including program governance, scientific impact, and timeline data

### 3.2 Data Processing Requirements

- Convert CSV data to JSON format for consumption by visualization components
- Create aggregated datasets for summary metrics and KPIs
- Normalize data categories for consistency across visualizations
- Generate derived datasets for specialized visualizations (e.g., networks, timeline data)

### 3.3 Data Update Process

- Establish a standardized format for data updates
- Create scripts to validate and process new data entries
- Implement version control for datasets to track changes over time

## 4. Dashboard Components and Features

### 4.1 Core Visualizations

1. **Program Overview Dashboard**
   - Key metrics and KPIs at the program level
   - Summary statistics on participants, samples, and project status
   - Timeline of program milestones

2. **Geographic Distribution Map**
   - Interactive map showing project locations and sample origins
   - Regional filtering and drill-down capabilities
   - Color-coding by initiative type or research focus

3. **Sample Distribution Visualizations**
   - Interactive charts showing distribution by body site category
   - Age group breakdowns across cohorts
   - Study type distribution

4. **Project Timeline and Status Tracker**
   - Gantt chart or timeline visualization of project progress
   - Status indicators for ongoing vs. completed projects
   - Sample collection progress vs. projections

5. **Relationships and Networks**
   - Sankey diagrams showing relationships between institutions, cohorts, and body sites
   - Virome-disease association networks (from literature and HVP findings)
   - Collaboration networks across HVP initiatives

### 4.2 Interactive Features

- **Dynamic Filtering**: Allow users to filter data by multiple parameters (initiative type, geographic region, body site, age group, etc.)
- **Search Functionality**: Enable searching for specific projects, institutions, or investigators
- **Data Export**: Provide options to export visualization data or generate reports
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure dashboard functions well on various device sizes

### 4.3 User Interface Elements

- Navigation sidebar with visualization categories
- Filters panel for interactive data exploration
- Information tooltips providing context for metrics and visualizations
- Dashboard header with program branding and high-level metrics

## 5. Implementation Phases

### 5.1 Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

- Set up GitHub repository structure
- Establish data processing pipeline
- Create basic page layout and navigation
- Implement core data loading and state management

### 5.2 Phase 2: Core Visualizations (Weeks 3-6)

- Develop the five core visualization components
- Implement basic interactivity and filtering
- Create responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- Add tooltips and contextual information

### 5.3 Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)

- Enhance interactivity with cross-filtering between visualizations
- Implement advanced search functionality
- Add data export options
- Develop any additional specialized visualizations

### 5.4 Phase 4: Polish and Launch (Weeks 9-10)

- Comprehensive testing across browsers and devices
- Performance optimization
- Documentation development
- Final review and launch

## 6. Technical Requirements

### 6.1 Development Environment

- Node.js for local development
- npm for package management
- Webpack for bundling
- Babel for JavaScript transpilation
- ESLint for code quality

### 6.2 Dependencies

- React.js (core framework)
- D3.js (data visualization)
- Chart.js/React-Vis (standard charts)
- Leaflet.js (maps)
- PapaParse (CSV parsing)
- Markdown-it (for rendering additional documentation)

### 6.3 Deployment

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
- Automated build and deployment to GitHub Pages
- Version tagging for releases

## 7. Data Maintenance Plan

### 7.1 Regular Updates

- Quarterly data refresh process
- Standardized templates for data submissions
- Data validation scripts to ensure quality

### 7.2 Version Control

- Maintain changelog for data updates
- Archive previous versions of datasets
- Document data schema changes

### 7.3 Long-term Sustainability

- Comprehensive documentation for future maintainers
- Modular code structure to facilitate future enhancements
- Automated tests to ensure reliability

## 8. Key Performance Indicators

### 8.1 Dashboard KPIs

The dashboard will visualize the following program KPIs:

- Total participants enrolled vs. target
- Samples collected vs. projected
- Geographic diversity index
- Age diversity coverage
- Body site coverage completeness
- Data sharing metrics

### 8.2 Dashboard Performance Metrics

The following metrics will be tracked for the dashboard itself:

- Page load time (<3 seconds target)
- Visualization render time (<1 second target)
- Filter response time (<0.5 seconds target)
- Cross-browser compatibility (support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile usability score

## 9. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Data inconsistencies across sources | High | Medium | Implement data validation and normalization scripts |
| Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | Medium | Use data aggregation and lazy loading techniques |
| Cross-browser compatibility issues | Medium | Low | Implement automated cross-browser testing |
| Changes to data schema over time | High | Medium | Design flexible data processing pipeline with version control |
| GitHub Pages limitations | Medium | Low | Have fallback hosting options identified |

## 10. Future Enhancements

- API integration with NIH RePORTER for real-time funding information
- Integration with publications database for citation metrics
- Advanced analytics features for trend identification
- User accounts for personalized dashboard views
- Expanded visualization types based on user feedback

## 11. Conclusion

This implementation plan outlines a comprehensive approach to developing the NIH Human Virome Program Dashboard as a GitHub Pages website. By following this phased implementation strategy, we will create an informative, interactive tool that provides valuable insights into the program's activities and impacts while being maintainable and extensible for future needs.
