      "content": "The NIH Human Virome Program (HVP) is a major research initiative designed to comprehensively characterize the human virome â€“ all viruses that exist within and on the human body. This program brings together researchers from multiple institutions to collect and analyze virome samples from diverse populations across various body sites. The goal is to establish a foundational understanding of the human virome in health and disease, and to develop resources, methods, and data that will benefit the broader scientific community."

      "content": "The HVP aims to transform our understanding of the human virome and its impact on health. Recent research has linked virome changes to conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and various neurological disorders. By characterizing the virome across diverse populations and body sites, the HVP will provide insights into how viruses contribute to human biology and disease, potentially leading to new diagnostic approaches, therapeutic targets, and prevention strategies."
