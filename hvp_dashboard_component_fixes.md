# HVP Project Dashboard Enhancements and Fixes

## Current Project Status

We've been working on the NIH Human Virome Program (HVP) Dashboard, a React application that visualizes data from the HVP research initiative. Recently, we've implemented several enhancements and fixes:

1. Added a Disease-Virome Network visualization that shows relationships between diseases and associated virome changes
2. Created data files containing structured information about program governance, timelines, and disease associations
3. Added additional program information components

## Current Issue: Visualization Component Rendering

We've encountered an issue where certain visualization components (specifically the "About HVP Program" and "Disease-Virome Network" views) briefly flash on screen but then default to a blank white page. 

## Implemented Fixes

To address this issue, we've made the following changes:

1. **View State Management**:
   - Added intermediate null state handling during view changes to force proper component remounting
   - Implemented delayed view transitions with setTimeout to prevent race conditions

2. **Loading Animation**:
   - Added a "Changing view..." animation during view transitions
   - Created loading animation styles with CSS animations

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added global error handlers to catch and log any runtime errors
   - Added try/catch blocks in component rendering

4. **Path Resolution**:
   - Corrected data file paths using process.env.PUBLIC_URL
   - Created all necessary JSON data files

## Files Modified

- `/src/App.js` - Added view state management logic
- `/src/components/Dashboard.js` - Added null state handling
- `/src/components/Dashboard.css` - Added loading animation styles
- `/src/components/Sidebar.js` - Modified click handling to ensure proper view changes
- `/src/index.js` - Added global error handlers
- `/src/components/visualizations/DiseaseViromeNetwork.js` - Added debugging logs
- `/src/components/programInfo/ProgramStructure.js` - Fixed missing data loading
- `/public/data/` - Created or updated JSON data files

## Next Steps

After Claude Code is restarted, we should:

1. Verify the changes solve the rendering issue
2. Run a build to make sure everything compiles correctly
3. Test navigation between different visualization components
4. Try exporting data from visualizations to verify that functionality
5. Push the changes to GitHub

## Key Code Changes

Here are the most important code changes we've made:

```javascript
// App.js - View State Management
const changeView = (view) => {
  console.log('App: Changing view to:', view);
  // If view is null, we're in the intermediate state during a view change
  if (view === null) {
    console.log('App: View temporarily set to null for re-rendering');
    setActiveView(null);
    return;
  }
  
  // Add a small delay before setting the view to ensure components unmount/remount properly
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('App: Actually setting view to:', view);
    setActiveView(view);
  }, 10);
};

// Dashboard.js - Null State Handling
const renderContent = () => {
  console.log('Dashboard renderContent called, activeView:', activeView);
  
  // If view is null or undefined, show a loading message
  if (activeView === null || activeView === undefined) {
    console.log('Dashboard: activeView is null or undefined, showing loading state');
    return <div className="loading-transition">Changing view...</div>;
  }
  
  // Rest of the function...
};

// Sidebar.js - Click Handling
<li 
  key={item.id}
  className={activeView === item.id ? 'active' : ''}
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Sidebar: Clicked on', item.id);
    // First set the view to null to force a re-render
    changeView(null);
    // Then set it to the actual view after a small delay
    setTimeout(() => changeView(item.id), 50);
  }}
