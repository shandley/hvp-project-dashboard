## Theme Persistence

### Test Cases

#### Local Storage Behavior
- **Initial Load**: System detects and applies system preference if no saved preference exists ✅
  - Correctly implemented in `getInitialTheme()` function in ThemeContext.js
  - Uses `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` to detect system preference
  - Defaults to light theme if no preference detected
- **After Toggle**: System saves user preference to localStorage after toggle ✅
  - Implemented in useEffect hook in ThemeContext.js
  - `localStorage.setItem('theme', theme)` is called whenever theme changes
- **Page Refresh**: System loads and applies saved preference on page refresh ✅
  - Preference retrieval implemented in `getInitialTheme()`
  - Correctly reads from localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('theme')`

#### Theme State Management
- **Global Context**: Theme state accessible throughout the application ✅
  - Used React Context API correctly
  - Provided custom hook `useTheme()` for easy access
- **Theme Toggle**: Toggle functionality works as expected ✅
  - Simple toggle function swaps between 'light' and 'dark'
  - Updates state which triggers the theme application
- **DOM Updates**: Theme changes applied to DOM ✅
  - Uses `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme)` to apply theme
  - CSS selectors `[data-theme="dark"]` applied correctly

### Assessment

The theme persistence mechanism is properly implemented using React's Context API and localStorage. The system correctly handles:
1. Initial theme detection based on system preference or saved preference
2. Saving user preference to localStorage when changed
3. Applying the theme to the DOM using CSS variables
4. Providing theme state and toggle function throughout the application

The implementation follows React best practices by:
1. Using context for global state management
2. Providing a custom hook for consuming the context
3. Using useEffect to handle side effects (DOM updates and localStorage)
4. Properly initializing state with a function to avoid unnecessary re-renders

No fixes required for theme persistence.
