# HVP Publication Analytics: Future Development Plans

This document outlines potential data visualization and analytics features that could be implemented for the HVP Publications dashboard as the number of publications grows.

## Proposed Analytics Features

### 1. Citation Impact Timeline

**Implementation:**
- Plot publications and their citation counts over time
- Use a line chart showing cumulative citations
- Include projected growth based on early citation patterns

**Value:**
- Shows research impact trajectory
- Highlights particularly influential papers
- Demonstrates growing influence of HVP research

**Data Requirements:**
- Historical citation counts (via iCite API)
- Publication dates
- Citation velocity metrics

### 2. Collaboration Network Graph

**Implementation:**
- Create a force-directed graph of author collaborations
- Nodes represent authors, edges represent co-authorship
- Size nodes by publication/citation count

**Value:**
- Visualizes research communities forming around HVP
- Highlights key collaborators and institutional relationships
- Shows interdisciplinary connections

**Data Requirements:**
- Complete author lists
- Institutional affiliations
- Co-authorship relationships

### 3. Topic/Keyword Evolution

**Implementation:**
- Extract keywords from abstracts using NLP
- Create a stream graph or heatmap showing topic evolution over time
- Filter by keyword to see related publications

**Value:**
- Shows how research focus evolves
- Identifies emerging research areas
- Helps researchers find relevant papers

**Data Requirements:**
- Publication abstracts
- Keywords (author-provided or extracted)
- Publication dates

### 4. Journal and Publication Type Distribution

**Implementation:**
- Create a treemap or donut chart of publications by journal
- Include journal impact factors
- Categorize by publication type (research article, review, etc.)

**Value:**
- Shows where HVP research is being published
- Indicates research quality via journal metrics
- Demonstrates diverse outputs (methods, reviews, research)

**Data Requirements:**
- Journal metadata
- Journal impact factors
- Publication type classifications

### 5. Geographic Research Distribution

**Implementation:**
- Map showing institutional locations
- Heat map indicating research activity by region
- Filter by research topic/keyword

**Value:**
- Shows global reach of HVP
- Identifies potential geographic gaps
- Facilitates new collaboration opportunities

**Data Requirements:**
- Author institutional affiliations
- Geocoded location data
- Institution metadata

### 6. Altmetrics Dashboard

**Implementation:**
- Integrate with Altmetric API
- Show social media mentions, news coverage, policy documents
- Compare traditional citation vs. alternative impact

**Value:**
- Provides broader impact measurement
- Shows public/media engagement
- Demonstrates policy relevance

**Data Requirements:**
- DOIs for all publications
- Integration with Altmetric API
- Social media tracking data

### 7. Funding Impact Analysis

**Implementation:**
- Link publications to specific HVP grants
- Show publication output per funding dollar
- Compare impact across different grant mechanisms

**Value:**
- Demonstrates return on investment
- Helps optimize future funding allocation
- Provides accountability to funders

**Data Requirements:**
- Detailed grant information
- Grant funding amounts
- Publication-grant linkages

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Data Collection Extensions

- Enhance the publication service to collect citation data from iCite API
- Implement a historical citation tracking system
- Add author affiliation geocoding for mapping visualizations
- Store additional metadata about journals, institutions, and grants

### Visualization Libraries

Several libraries could be used to build these visualizations:

- **D3.js**: For custom, interactive visualizations
- **Plotly.js** or **Chart.js**: For simpler statistical charts
- **React-Force-Graph**: For network visualizations
- **MapBox** or **Leaflet**: For geographic visualizations

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy

- Design visualizations to work with minimal data initially
- Add informative placeholders for metrics that will become available as publications accumulate
- Include educational tooltips explaining the metrics and their significance
- Implement graceful fallbacks when data is sparse

### User Controls

- Time range filters for temporal analysis
- Topic/keyword filters for content-based filtering
- Publication type and journal filters
- Export functionality for data and visualizations

## Development Priority

Suggested implementation order based on value and complexity:

1. Citation Impact Timeline (high value, medium complexity)
2. Journal and Publication Type Distribution (high value, low complexity)
3. Topic/Keyword Evolution (high value, medium complexity)
4. Collaboration Network Graph (medium value, medium complexity)
5. Geographic Research Distribution (medium value, high complexity)
6. Altmetrics Dashboard (medium value, high complexity)
7. Funding Impact Analysis (high value, high complexity)

## Timeline Considerations

- Initial implementation could focus on building the data collection infrastructure
- First visualizations should be those that work well with limited data
- More complex visualizations should be added as the publication count increases

This plan provides a roadmap for transforming the publications page from a simple list into a powerful research analytics platform that becomes increasingly valuable as the HVP publication portfolio grows.
